  - [x] Allow for n_epochs=0 in SimDP.run() so initial grid can be had
  - [x] Specify n_next_epochs in SimDP.run() to split sim into segments
  - [x] Return successive cell density grids to Python after each sim segment
  - [x] Mod test py to generate a set of successive grids
  - [x] Mod test nb to generate a set of successive grid images
  - [x] Generate an animation from such a set of images
  - [x] Test periodic topology again
  - [x] Implement distinct x/y/z topologies (mostly done)
  - [ ] Implement fixed value bcs on each boundary
  - [ ] Implement fixed flux bcs on each boundary
