  - [ ] Allow for n_epochs=0 in SimDP.run() so initial grid can be had
  - [ ] Specify n_next_epochs in SimDP.run() to split sim into segments
  - [ ] Return successive cell density grids to nb after each sim segment
  - [ ] Mod test nb to generate a set of successive imaged grids
  - [ ] Generate an animation from such a set of images
  - [ ] Test periodic topology again
  - [ ] Implement distinct x/y/z topologies
  - [ ] Implement fixed value bcs on each boundary
  - [ ] Implement fixed flux bcs on each boundary
